# Local Football League

## step by step how to get the project up and running:

 - create a new directory or folder to contain project directory and its virtual env
 - create your env via `python3 -m venv env`
 - activate your env `source env/bin/activate`
 - cd to your project directory `cd [project_directory]`
 - install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - run migrations `python manage.py migrate`
 - create your admin `python manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the prompt steps
 - collect staticfiles via `python manage.py collectstatic`
 - run django server `python manage.py runserver` and enjoy!
 
 
 

## It might be a little  different if you're on a `Windows` or `Mac` OS.





### Thank you for your time and consideration.
